# Navigating sampling bias in discrete phylogeographic analysis: assessing the performance of an adjusted Bayes factor

Bayesian phylogeographic inference is a popular tool in molecular epidemiological studies, enabling the reconstruction of the dispersal history of rapidly evolving pathogens. Discrete phylogeographic analysis (DTA) integrates geographic information as discrete characters and infers lineage transition events among discrete locations. DTAs are usually followed by a Bayes factor (BF) test that assesses the statistical support for inferred transition links. by comparing their posterior and prior expectations. In the standard BF (BF<sub>std</sub>) test approach, the relative abundance of the involved trait states is not considered, which can be problematic in case of unbalanced sampling among discrete locations. Although several strategies have been proposed to address sampling bias in DTA, they might require additional epidemiological information. In this study, we formally assess the performance of a modification of the BFstd, the adjusted Bayes factor (BF<sub>adj</sub>), which attempts to incorporate information on the relative abundance of samples by location when inferring support for transition events and root location inference without requiring external data. Using a simulation framework, we assess the performance of the standard BF<sub>std</sub> and BF<sub>adj</sub> under varying levels of sampling bias, estimating their type I (false positive) and type II (false negative) error rates. Our results show that BF<sub>adj</sub> complements the BF<sub>std</sub> (i) by reducing type I errors, leading to fewer false positive inferred transition events or root location, but at the cost of increasing type II errors and thus decreasing statistical power, particularly in highly biased scenarios; and (ii) by simultaneously reducing both type I and type II errors when estimating statistical support associated with the inference of the root location. Our findings provide guidelines on how to implement and use the complementary BFadj to detect and mitigate the impact of sampling bias on the outcomes of discrete phylogeographic inference.
